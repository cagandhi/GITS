# Phase 3 - Experiments
We hosted total 10 experiments. Each experiment session was attended by 2 session hosts and 1 lab rat.  
Duties of the session hosts were as follows:  
* Primary Host: Guide the whole session, resolve any issues and answer lab rat's question. Primary host was also responsible for time tracking of task being performed.
* Secondary Host: Responsible for taking other manual obeservations explained in the later sections.

# Methods
Each participant was given a repository by the person hosting the session. We defined the set of tasks to be performed on that repository in each experiment. 
* ### General tasks
  1. Clone the given repo
  2. Add Your username and Email to the git configuration
  3. Create Branch “branch1”.
  4. Switch to main branch
  5. Create Branch “branch2”
  6. Switch to branch “branch1”
  7. Show branches
* ### Branch1 tasks
  8. Create file “test1.txt” and add `"hello test1"` in file
  9. Stage the “test1.txt” file
  10. Create file “test2.txt” and add `"hello test2"` in file
  11. Stage the “test2.txt” file
  12. Commit the changes and add `"my first commit"` commit message to it
  13. Change the content of “test2.txt”  file from `"hello test2"` to `"hello test2 new"`.
  14. Stage the file “test2.txt”.
  15. Unstage the file “test2.txt”.
  16. Remove the uncommitted changes made to the file “test2.txt”.
  17. Switch to main branch.
  18. Merge the branch branch1 to main branch. Push the main branch to remote.
* ### Branch2 tasks
  19. Switch to branch “branch2”.
  20. Make “branch2” upto date with local main branch.
  21. (a) By this time, your remote main branch is updated by the host of your session. If not, confirm with the host.
  21. (b) Make “branch2” upto date with remote main branch.
* ### Main branch tasks
  22. Switch to main branch
  23. Delete the latest 1 commit from local as well as remote “main” branch
  24. Suppose you have messed up the repo. You want to delete the local repo and re-clone it. Do it.

# It vs Not It
Each experiment was divided into 2 halves.

In the first half, participant perfomed the given set of tasks using **gits** command. While in the second half, same set of experiments were performed with just **traditional git** commands. 

The performance of each environment was measured using various metrics shown in Materials section.
