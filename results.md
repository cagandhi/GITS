# Phase 3 - Experiments
We hosted total 10 experiments. Each experiment session was attended by 2 session hosts and 1 lab rat.  
Duties of the session hosts were as follows:  
* Primary Host: Guide the whole session, resolve any issues and answer lab rat's question. Primary host was also responsible for time tracking of task being performed.
* Secondary Host: Responsible for taking other manual obeservations explained in the later sections.
